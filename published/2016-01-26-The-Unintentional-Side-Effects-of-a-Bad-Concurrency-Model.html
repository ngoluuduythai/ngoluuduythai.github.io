How we collaborate, the organizations we work in and the
programming languages we use effect software architectures in ways that
are not immediately obvious.

In this article I argue that monolithic GitHub projects, inflexible
organizational structures and sequential programming languages all lead
to bad software architectures.

This effect is unintentional and a side effect which I believe stems
from a poor understanding of concurrency.

Software architectures are all about collaboration - we solve complex
problems by breaking them into simpler parts, and the simpler parts
collaborate to solve the larger problem.

Any system that cannot flexibly create simpler parts and allow them to
work in parallel will be difficult to work with.

Ideally if the problem can be describe as the interaction between N
independent interaction agents, then it should be programmed or
organized as N independent interacting agents.

Conversely if a problem cannot be described in terms of independent
communicating parts it will be difficult to understand and difficult to
implement.

The ease with which we can change the number of
parts and how they interact has profound consequences for
the success of the architecture.

Have said this, I'll examine three factors that influence architectures
in an unintentionally bad manner.

* Static Organizational Structures

Thirty odd years ago I got a job at Ericsson and was introduced to
the architecture of the AXE system. I was initially confused when I
learned about the software architecture of the AXE system since it appeared
to be very similar to the organizational structure of a large part of
the company.

Sometimes I saw diagrams describing the organization, other times
I saw documents describing the software structure and they appeared to be the
same.

> What I did't initially understand that they were the same - The
organizations structure was exactly the same as the software
structure. One block, one group, they were identical.

This made a lot of sense - the software was stable and mature
and the architecture did not change.

Now changing an organizational structure is far more difficult than changing
a software architecture - so software structure can change quickly but
organizations cannot.

Later, I moved to different projects and discovered that the software
architecture follows the organizational structure.

Suppose a new project was being started, and at the time when it was
being started three groups of programmers became free having finished
another project.  Guess how many major components the new project
would have? You guessed right, three, because three groups had become
available at the time when the new project started.

So the problem of designing a system architecture, became the problem
of splitting the initial problem into three approximately equal
programming tasks and not the problem of finding a natural division of
the problem into small interacting parts.

I view this as a kind of concurrency problem. If the problem could be
described in terms of five interacting components, then it would be
best programmed by five interacting groups, and not three, or seven
because the organization happen to have three or seven groups
available at the time.

* Collaboration Methods

How do we collaborate in software projects? - specifically how we
collaborate in Open Source projects? The dominant model of
collaboration is by manipulation of a common archive. Typically
GitHub.

GibHub collaborations are essentially shared memory transactions. The
transaction manager (project owner) decides to commit a new set of
changes or disallow them.  As with all shared memory concurrent reads
are possible but concurrent writes are disallowed and must be
sequentially ordered - otherwise chaos will ensue.

Some of us think that shared memory programming is a nightmare -
people tinkering with my code or my tinkering with other peoples code
that I don't really understand is a recipe for disaster.

Collaborating in a communal project is not easy. The biggest problem
is getting into the mind set of the people who built and maintain the
project. Mature open source projects can have thousands of files and
directories and knowing exactly where to add your stuff is by no means
easy. Even though you think you know what you're doing a change that
appears to work can easily break somebody else's code.

This is incidentally how two humans interact and collaborate. If I
want to collaborate with my friend I don't open up their head with a
carving knife, insert new neural synapses, then sew up everything and
hope that it will work. No I talk to them, I say "can you do this?"
and they talk back - we interact by exchanging messages.

This is how distributed applications work - they work by exchanging
messages.  In fact this is the only way they possibly could work. The
clue lies in the name **distributed** - distributed means that the parts
of the application are indifferent physical places so they have to
collaborate by exchanging messages which in the best case travel at
the speed of light, and in most case a lot lot slower.

The most common way to build distributed things and the most
successful way of creating collaborative things is the WWW. Of all
the ways of building object on the Internet the dominant way is to use the
HTTP protocol layered over TCP sockets. I'll call this HTTP-over-TCP.

Of course HTTP-over-TCP is not the only way of doing things, there are
many other combinations we could choose.

Recently I've been experimenting with two alternatives JSON-over-TCP and
OSC-over-UDP - both have their advantages and disadvantages, so I'm
going to discuss these here:

Firstly I want to use JSON-over-TCP and OSC-over-UDP for 
purely *internal* collaboration. These messages are never intended to escape
the local machine/Internet boundary so I don't have to worry about security.
 
What are these little projects:

The first is JSON-over-TCP, this started with my [[http://joearms.github.io/2016/01/04/fun-with-swift.html][Fun with Swift]]
article. After I published this I was contacted by Chris Eidhof who
very kindly sent me a copy of [[https://www.objc.io/books/functional-swift/][Functional Swift]] which he had
co-authored so I was very glad to hear from him. Some of my hours of
struggling were solved by a quick tip from Chris.

Chris and I started mailing each other and he soon had made a simple
JSON-over-TCP proof of concept where we can build a remote GUI by
sending JSON messages over TCP. The project is still in
proof-of-concept stage but there is some code to play with 
at [[https://github.com/chriseidhof/tcp-json-swift][https://github.com/chriseidhof/tcp-json-swift]] and I was able to send
messages from Erlang to Swift and a window popped up.  Early days, but
looking good.

Chris and I would like to implement something like [[http://shoesrb.com/][Shoes]] -- for those
of you who have never used shoes the first version was written by the
extremely talented [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff][Why the Lucky Stiff]].

> Unfortunately the Internet does not have permanent references, so
much of what the Lucky Stiff wrote seems to have vanished.  This is
why we should all support Juan Benet in his attempts to build [[(http://ipfs.io/][The
Interplanetary File System]] and resist storing our data in impermanent
clouds.  Let's not destroy history for future generations by sticking
our data in a proprietary cloud.

The nice thing about separating the GUI client from the GUI server is
that neither of us needs to know *anything* about the internal
structure of the other guys project. <span style='color:red'>My
project is written in Erlang</span> and has a directory structure and
build system that I'm happy with. <span style='color:red'>Chris's
project is written in Swift</span> and has a directory structure and
build system that he is happy with, but <span
style='color:red'>neither of us needs to know how the other side has
implemented their code</span>.  All we need to agree on are what
messages should be send and what the messages mean.

The second project is a collaboration with Sam Aaron focused on 
the [[http://sonic-pi.net/][Sonic Pi]].
This project uses OSC messaging with UDP transport, which
I'll call OSC-over-UDP.

OSC-over-UDP as a way of gluing projects together is described
in a [[http://joearms.github.io/2016/01/28/A-Badass-Way-To-Connect-Programs-Together.html][A
Badass Way to Connect Things Together]].
 
* Programming Languages

Why do we have monolithic projects? I believe this is because it is
difficult to build communicating components in what are essentially
sequential programming languages. Concurrency has been forgotten in
most programming languages, and when it has been added it seems like a
afterthought, not as an act of conscious design.

In a very large number of programming languages the only way to program
a concurrent application is to ``do it yourself'' and simulate
concurrency by storing the state of a suspended process in a data
base or some equally horrid constructions involving a mess of callback
and promises.

Sequential languages are designed to write sequential programs, and the
only way for a sequential program to grow in functionality is for it
to get larger. It's technically difficult to split it into cooperating
processes so this is not usually done. The concurrency in the
application cannot be used to structure the application.

> We should grow things by adding more small communicating objects,
rather than making larger and larger non-communicating objects.

Concentrating on the communication provides a higher level of
abstraction than concentrating on the function APIs used within the
system.  Black-box equivalence says that two systems are equivalent if
they cannot be distinguished by observing their communication
patterns. Two black-boxes are equivalent if they have identical
input/output behavior.

When we connect black boxes together we don't care what programming
languages have been used inside the black boxes, we don't care how
the code inside the black boxes has been organized, we just have to
obey the communication protocols.

If you look at most GitHub projects - they are built as monolithic
single language applications, they are not built from small
communicating components written in different languages.

In the Internet world, we program differently. Here it is possible to
structure applications as `micro-services` usually using HTTP-over-TCP
or JSON-over-TCP AJAX and so on, but this is not used **internally**
inside the OS to any large extent.

> Erlang programs are the exception. Erlang programs are
intentionally structured as communicating processes - they are the ultimate
micro-services.

Large Erlang applications have a flat ``bus like'' structure. They are
structured as independent parallel applications hanging off a common
communication bus. This leads to architectures that are easy to
understand and debug and collaborations which are easy to program.
