A year of so ago I stumbled upon a *really bad* website -- it was 
stunningly bad. Unfortunately I lost the link. I also lost a link to
what was a pretty good MS-DOS style interface.

<marquee><font color="red">And I'd Forgotten about the
&lt;marquee> tag</font></marquee>

And tragically the `<blink>` tag doesn't work any more...

Added note: Within a couple of hours of publishing this
artice Roger Lipscombe added this link in the comments
http://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/ -- this is the site I was thinking
about. Thanks Roger.

So what's on a really bad website?

* It's pre CSS - with hand-written HTML
* It has totally crap layout
* It has rotating scrolling banners
* The background color clashes with the text colors making the text unreadable
* It has a //this this site is being constructed// icon showing a man digging
* It plays midi bagpipe music when you visit the page (there was a Hotel on Loch Ness - that played bagpipe music and had bagpipers waving at you) - I shall have to find this in the web archive.
* The entire page was a few KBytes
* It was written by amateurs

Now unfortunately these works of art have vanished from the net.


<<<
Now all I see are boring websites made with Twitter Bootstrap and with 200 KB of JavaScript that tracks you
<<<

Please help me find these old sites and post links in the comments.

Once I've found suitable horrible examples I'll try and remake my blog
to make it visually more attractive.

Are then any CSS frameworks that help you make truly horrible websites?
